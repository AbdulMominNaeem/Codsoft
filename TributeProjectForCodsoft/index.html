              Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was born on 26 February 1954 in a poor
              conservative Muslim family. According to historian M. Hakan Yavuz,
              Erdoğan was born in Güneysu, Rize, and later his family moved to
              Kasimpaşa, a poor neighborhood of Istanbul. Erdoğan's family is
              originally from Adjara, a region in Georgia. Although Erdoğan was
              reported to have said in 2003 that he was of Georgian origin and
              that his origins were in Batumi, he later denied this. His parents
              were Ahmet Erdoğan (1905-1988) and Tenzile Erdoğan (née Mutlu;
              1924-2011). Erdoğan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his
              father was a captain in the Turkish Coast Guard. His summer
              holidays were mostly spent in Güneysu, Rize, where his family
              originates. Throughout his life he often returned to this
              spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a
              mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul
              when Erdoğan was 13 years old. As a teenager, Erdoğan's father
              provided him with a weekly allowance of 2.5 Turkish lira, less
              than a dollar. With it, Erdoğan bought postcards and resold them
              on the street. He sold bottles of water to drivers stuck in
              traffic. Erdoğan also worked as a street vendor selling simit
              (sesame bread rings), wearing a white gown and selling the simit
              from a red three-wheel cart with the rolls stacked behind glass.
              In his youth, Erdoğan played semi-professional football in
              Camialtispor FC, a local club. Fenerbahçe wanted him to transfer
              to the clubrification needed] but his father prevented it. The
              stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew
              up, Kasimpaşa S.K. is named after him. Erdoğan is a member of the
              Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish Sufistic community of
              Naqshbandi tariqah.

              In 1976, Erdoğan engaged in politics by joining the National
              Turkish Student Union, an anti-communist action group. In the same
              year, he became the head of the Beyoğlu youth branch of the
              Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP), and was later promoted to
              chair of the Istanbul youth branch of the party. Holding this
              position until 1980, he served as consultant and senior executive
              in the private sector during the era following the 1980 military
              coup when political parties were closed down. In 1983, Erdoğan
              followed most of Necmettin Erbakan's followers into the Islamist
              Welfare Party. He became the party's Beyoğlu district chair in
              1984, and in 1985 he became the chair of the Istanbul city branch.
              Erdoğan entered the parliamentairy by-elections of 1986 as a 6th
              district candidate of Istanbul, but gained no seat as his party
              ended as the fifth largest party in the by-elections. Three years
              later, Erdoğan ran for mayor of Beyoğlu district. He finished
              second in the election with 22.8% of the votes. Erdoğan was
              elected to parliament in 1991, but he was barred from taking his
              seat due to preferential voting.

            <p>
              In the local elections of 1994, Erdoğan ran as a candidate for
              Mayor of Istanbul. He was a 40-year-old dark horse candidate who
              had been mocked by the mainstream media and treated as a country
              bumpkin by his opponents. He won the election with 25.19% of the
              popular vote, making it the first time a mayor of Istanbul got
              elected from his political party.<br />
              He was pragmatic in office, tackling many chronic problems in
              Istanbul including water shortage, pollution and traffic chaos.
              The water shortage problem was solved with the laying of hundreds
              of kilometers of new pipelines. The garbage problem was solved
              with the establishment of state-of-the-art recycling facilities.
              While Erdoğan was in office, air pollution was reduced through a
              plan developed to switch to natural gas. He changed the public
              buses to environmentally friendly ones. The city's traffic and
              transportation jams were reduced with more than fifty bridges,
              viaducts, and highways built. He took precautions to prevent
              corruption, using measures to ensure that municipal funds were
              used prudently. He paid back a major portion of Istanbul
              Metropolitan Municipality's two-billion-dollar debt and invested
              four billion dollars in the city. He also opened up City Hall to
              the people, gave out his e-mail address and established municipal
              hot lines.<br />
              Erdoğan initiated the first roundtable of mayors during the
              Istanbul conference, which led to a global, organized movement of
              mayors. A seven-member international jury from the United Nations
              unanimously awarded Erdoğan the UN-Habitat award.
